# NongoFit
A **Non**-**go**od **Fit**ness-tracking app. Emphasis probably wasn't necessary.

The trial version of my treadmill's 'official' app ran out, and rather than pay
for a subsciption I figured why not spend way more time to write something
worse? For now this is just a manual tracker, but eventually will communicate
directly with the treadmill over Bluetooth.
